[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ddfd52cf-82d4-434d-a80c-49ce7fedf9a7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/xenodochial-boyd-656d45/deploys)

Made with gatsby & deployed using netlify.

To run the project locally use...

```bash
~$ yarn
```

To install the required deps

```bash
~$ yarn develop
```

To run the project locally you can either use.

OR

```bash
~$ yarn start
```

If you plan on updating the submission forms, `yarn start` is recommended. However this command requires the [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/#how-it-works). This runs 2 commands using concurrently.

1. First, the [Gatsby Development Service](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
2. Finally, the entire [Netlify Platform](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) locally.

If you'd like to introduce any changes simply start a PR on main and shoot an email to [kyle@dimstar.io](mailto:someone@yoursite.com)
